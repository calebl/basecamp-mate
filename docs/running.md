# Running the sync

## Run it once

Needs Python 3.11+, `tasks-axi`, and an authenticated `basecamp` CLI.

```sh
python3 sync.py --home ~/path/to/home --config ~/path/to/home/data/basecamp-sync/config.json --dry-run
```

A run from the command line runs only the steps that are due, like the timer; add `--all`
to run every step now. Drop `--dry-run` to apply. `run.sh <home> <config> [--dry-run]` is
the scheduled entry point: it runs `sync.py renew`, then `sync.py`, all within a 240-second
cap (the renewal gets at most 80 seconds, each `basecamp auth` call 30).

`sync.py renew` ([`login.py`](../login.py)) renews the OAuth token when it expires within 15
minutes (by the token's own `expires_at`) and guards the login the `basecamp` CLI keeps in
`credentials.json` (its file store, used with `BASECAMP_NO_KEYRING=1`):

- Before a renewal it copies that file to `credentials.json.basecamp-mate-backup` beside it
  (mode 0600), but only while the file still holds the profile. After a renewal that worked
  it copies the file again, so the copy never holds a refresh token the renewal spent. Every
  home and login shares the copy, so it is merged rather than replaced: an entry the file has
  already lost stays in the copy.
- It guards only the file store: `BASECAMP_NO_KEYRING` is set, `auth status` reports
  `"storage": "file"`, or status names no store and the backup holds the login. A login kept
  in the system keyring is only renewed, even when an old file backup holds it.
- Each entry is restored at most once per copy, by its own mark, so an emptied file never
  brings back another profile's login that was already restored and refused.
- If the profile is missing after the renewal, it puts the missing entry back from the copy
  (every entry when the whole file was emptied) and logs one `login: restored` line. It
  does this once per copy: if the restored login is refused again, it logs one
  `FAILED token refresh` line naming the `basecamp auth login` to run and stops renewing,
  since Basecamp blocks an address after a handful of refused renewals.
- After a renewal it flushes the file to disk, so a power cut cannot bring back the
  refresh token the renewal just spent.
- A run that cannot reach Basecamp (the minute after boot, before the network is up)
  leaves the stored login alone and skips the sync. This is not counted as a login failure;
  one `network:` line marks when the outage starts and one when it ends.

A failed renewal logs its `FAILED token refresh` line once per cause and then hourly, not
every run. A run first claims what its config watches and refuses to
run beside another home's live run on the same thing with the same login;
`--allow-duplicate` overrides that for one run (see [One home per project and login](multiple-homes.md)).

## A dedicated Basecamp user

To act as its own user instead of the captain, invite that user to the project, sign it
in as a separate CLI login, verify it, and set `"profile"` in the config:

```sh
basecamp auth login -P firstmate --account <account id>
basecamp api get /my/profile.json -P firstmate
```

Its token is short-lived; `run.sh` renews it with `basecamp auth refresh -P <profile>`
(through `sync.py renew`, which guards the stored login; see [Run it once](#run-it-once)).
Full setup steps, and what changes for the captain: [firstmate-account.md](firstmate-account.md).

## A systemd timer by hand

`init` installs a 30-second timer; to set one up by hand instead,
`~/.config/systemd/user/basecamp-sync.service` (also in [`examples/`](../examples)):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Mirror a firstmate backlog into its Basecamp project

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=%h/src/basecamp-mate/run.sh %h/path/to/firstmate-home %h/path/to/firstmate-home/data/basecamp-sync/config.json
```

`~/.config/systemd/user/basecamp-sync.timer`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Basecamp sync for a firstmate backlog, every 30 seconds

[Timer]
OnBootSec=2min
OnUnitActiveSec=30s
AccuracySec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

```sh
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now basecamp-sync.timer
```

# Config and state

One config per home, normally `<home>/data/basecamp-sync/config.json`, written by `init`
or by hand from
[`examples/config.example.json`](../examples/config.example.json):

- `account`, `project`: Basecamp ids.
- `captain`: the captain's Basecamp person id: the assignee, and the only person whose
  word is a decision or approval.
- `operators` (optional): Basecamp person ids whose word authorizes the agent as the
  captain's does (approvals, decisions); they are listened to like the captain. Default:
  none. See [People the sync listens to](people.md).
- `people` (optional): the Basecamp person ids whose lines, comments and boosts are
  relayed, as participants; the captain is always included. Default: just the captain.
  Neither list needs its people on the project; a re-run of `init` keeps both unless
  `--replace-people`.
- `project_people` (optional): `{"<project id>": [person ids]}`: named participants heard
  only in that project. Default: none.
- `participants` (optional): `{"project": true}`, `{"company": true | <company id>}` and/or
  `{"domains": ["<domain>", ...]}`: also relay what anyone on the project (not a client), in
  the captain's (or that) company, or with an email at a domain, writes to the agent, as a
  participant's. Domains need a login that sees email addresses (an account admin).
- `blocked` (optional): `{}` or `{"reply": "<text>"}`: someone the sync does not listen to who
  @mentions, Pings or assigns the agent gets one short automatic reply (the default text, or
  yours). Absent or `false`: no reply. Either way nothing they write reaches the agent. `init`
  writes `{}` for a new home and keeps an existing home's setting. See [Blocked senders](people.md#blocked-senders).
- `allow_duplicate` (optional): `true` lets a timer run go ahead beside another home's live
  run that watches the same thing with the same login. See [One home per project and
  login](multiple-homes.md).
- `profile` (optional): the `basecamp` CLI login every call runs as (`-P <profile>`),
  including `run.sh`'s token refresh. Absent means the CLI's default login. It changes
  only who acts; `captain` stays the assignee and the only person whose 👍 approves, and
  the acting user's own comments and boosts are never relayed.
- `todos` (optional): `{}`, `{"todoset": "<to-do set id>"}` or `{"list": "<to-do list id>"}`,
  with `"project": <id>` when they are in another project of the account (default: the
  configured project): where `sync.py todo create` puts the owner's to-dos by default
  (loose on the set, or in the list); turns on the to-do comment reader. One decision can
  go elsewhere with `todo create --project`, `--list` or `--card-table --column` (a card);
  its comments, boosts, replies and completion then happen in that project, and its
  notifications are this home's.
- `message_board` (optional): the message board id `sync.py post-message` posts on; the
  owner's boosts on the agent's messages there are relayed.
- `timezone` (optional): an IANA zone name (like `America/Chicago`) for the times the sync
  writes for people: records' `at_local`, inbox notes and the session alert. Unset, the
  captain's Basecamp time zone (their profile's `time_zone`) is used, and UTC when that
  can't be read.
- `inbox` (optional): `{}` or `{"fm_home": "<firstmate home>"}`: deliver each new pending
  record as a note in that home's inbox (default: the `--home`).
- `session_alert` (optional, needs `inbox`): `{"chat": <chat id>, "after_minutes": 15}`: post
  one line to the owner in that chat once no firstmate session holds that home's lock while
  an inbox note has waited `after_minutes`.
- `notifications` (optional): on whenever `profile` is set. `false` turns it off;
  `{"mark_read": false}` leaves handled notifications unread; `{"unmonitored": false}`
  turns off `unmonitored` records. See [Notifications](notifications.md).
- `mentions` (optional): `{}` or `{"scope": "project" | "account"}`: `"account"` relays the
  owner's @mentions of the acting login, and comments on threads it follows, from every
  project of the account (one home per login); the default `"project"` only from this one.
  Needs notifications. See [Notifications](notifications.md) (Mentions anywhere in the account).
- `listen` (retired): ignored, with one note in `sync.log`; its `"unmonitored": false` still
  applies. See [Upgrading from the event listener](notifications.md#upgrading-from-the-event-listener).
- `pings` (optional): `{}` or `{"limit": <n>}`: relay the owner's Pings (direct messages)
  to the acting login, reading at most `n` Pings a run (default 10).
- `assigned_todos` (optional): `{}` or `{"limit": <n>, "scope": "project" | "account"}`:
  treat a to-do a listened-to person assigns to the acting login as a request, fetching at
  most `n` newly assigned to-dos a sweep (default 10); `"scope": "account"` takes them from
  every project of the account (one home per login), the default `"project"` only from this
  one. See [To-do requests](todo-requests.md).
- `assigned_cards` (optional): `{}` or `{"limit": <n>, "scope": "project" | "account"}`: the
  same for cards assigned to the acting login, never one the card mirror made. See [To-do
  requests](todo-requests.md) (Cards).
- `assigned_steps` (optional): `{}` or `{"limit": <n>, "scope": "project" | "account"}`: the
  same for card steps assigned to the acting login. See [To-do requests](todo-requests.md)
  (Card steps).
- `chats` (optional): chat (Campfire) ids whose owner questions are relayed.
  An entry may be `{"chat": <id>, "every_line": true}` to relay every owner line in that chat.
- `ask_chat` (optional): the chat id `sync.py ask` posts in.
- `checkins` (optional): `{"questionnaires": ["<questionnaire id>", ...], "timezone":
  "<IANA zone, e.g. America/Chicago>"}`. Use the account's time zone so the schedule's
  hour and minute match Basecamp's.
- `releases` (optional): `{"board": "<message board id>", "repos": {"owner/name": "<name>"
  or {"name": "<name>", "note": "<text>"}}, "prereleases": false}`. The name is the
  subject's first word (capitalized; `init` uses the mapped board name) and the note is
  appended to the body, e.g. `` "note": "Run `ta upgrade` to install." ``.
- `advisories` (optional): `{"repos": ["owner/name", ...]}`: record each new security
  advisory and each new or reopened open Dependabot alert of these GitHub repositories
  once. See Security advisories in [safety-bounds.md](safety-bounds.md).
- `acknowledge` (optional): `{"read": "<emoji>", "decided": "<emoji>" | false}`: the boost
  put on everything read (`read`; `reply` takes it off once it answers), and on each deciding
  comment (the captain's or an operator's on a decision to-do or a to-do or card a decision
  step is on) once `todo complete` or `todo subtask` carries the decision out (`decided`,
  which also takes the read boost off). Absent: 👀 on a question and 👍 on anything else
  when read, nothing after deciding, as before. `init` writes `{"read": "👀", "decided":
  "👍"}` for a new home and keeps an existing home's.
- `schedule` (optional): `{"dated": "ask" | "due" | "before", "recurring": "ask" | "due" |
  "before"}`: when a scheduled request is done by default, carried on its records as `when`
  (with its `list`): `ask` the owner (a comment on it), on its `due` date, or `before` it.
  `"recurring"` applies to a repeating request, `"dated"` to one with only a due date.
  `sync.py schedule set --list <id> --dated ...` remembers an answer for one to-do list (or
  card column), and without `--list` for every list without its own, in `schedule.json`,
  which wins over the config. `init` writes `{"dated": "ask", "recurring": "due"}` for a new
  home with requests on and keeps an existing home's; without it, records carry no `when`
  and the home's defaults file's wording stands.
- `backup` (optional): `{"project": <bucket id>, "vault": <Docs & Files folder id>}`: keep
  one latest copy of the config and each state file in that folder, uploaded daily when
  changed. See Backup in [safety-bounds.md](safety-bounds.md).
- `timesheet` (optional): `{}`: post the
  agent's active time per to-do or card per finished day to its timesheet. See [Timesheets](timesheets.md).
- `cards` (optional): the card mirror's switch. Absent means on when `tables` is set and
  off otherwise; `false` turns it off even with `tables` present.
- `repos` (card mirror): backlog repo name -> board name.
- `tables` (card mirror): per board, the card table id (`table`) and a column id for each of
  `Triage`, `Not now`, `Figuring it out`, `In progress`, `Ready for QA`, `Done`.

Everything else lives beside the config, never in this repo (except each config's run
claim, in `~/.local/state/basecamp-mate/runs/`; see [One home per project and login](multiple-homes.md)):

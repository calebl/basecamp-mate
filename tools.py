"""The tools layer: small, single-purpose Basecamp operations, with no policy.

A tool does one explicit thing to the configured account and project, through the
`basecamp` CLI (or `gh`, `tasks-axi`, `lavish-axi` for the local and GitHub reads):

  - readers poll Basecamp and append what they find to pending-comments.jsonl, once
    each, with a cursor or seen-list kept beside the config: card comments and
    approvals, chat lines, the owner's lines in Pings (direct messages to the acting
    login, each in a bucket of its own), due check-in questions, comments on tracked
    to-dos, to-dos the owner assigns to the acting login (as requests, then their edits
    and closing), the owner's comments and @mentions on any other thread the acting login is
    subscribed to or mentioned in;
    the notification and boost readers (`/my/readings.json`, `/my/boosts.json`) only
    hand what changed to a behavior, `mark_read` marks notifications read, and the
    unmonitored recorder records, once per kind, the owner input no behavior handles;
    a boost on the acting login's own recording is recorded only once this run's read of
    its received boosts lists it (`confirmed`); who is heard, and whose word authorizes,
    is `role` (the captain, "operators", "people", "project_people" in their project and
    admitted "participants"; `access` prints them), and
    anyone else who addresses the acting login is dropped, with one automatic reply
    when "blocked" is on (`block`);
  - commands post exactly what the agent hands them: `reply`, `ask`, `answer`,
    `todo create|track|comment|complete`, `post-message`; `unmonitored handle|forget`
    only edit local state;
  - primitives the behaviors compose: card create/update/move/assign/unassign, a
    Message Board post, acknowledgement boosts.

A tool never decides to act on what it reads. Which readers run on the timer, and
what the agent does with a pending record, is the behaviors layer (behaviors.py,
and prompts/base.md for the agent's side).

Every command that speaks as the agent (reply, ask, answer, the to-do commands and
post-message) posts nothing when no profile is set, or when the profile signs in as
the owner, and `--dry-run` only logs. All state lives in the directory holding the
config.

        """Create a to-do (or a card) assigned to the owner and track it in todos.json under `key`.

        `subtasks` are the decisions when the to-do carries more than one, every one
        included: each becomes a native Basecamp subtask of the to-do (`basecamp
        subtasks`, CLI 0.12.0+), unassigned so the owner is notified once (by the parent), kept in the record in order,
        each completed by `todo_subtask`.

        It goes in `project` (any project of the account; default "todos": {"project": id}, else
        the configured project): loose on the configured to-do set ("todos": {"todoset": id},
        or the project's only one), or into a list (`todolist`, else "todos": {"list": id}).
        The configured to-do set and list belong to the configured decisions project, so
        another `project` takes only `todolist`. `card` ((card table id, column id)) makes it a
        card in that column instead, assigned to the owner and tracked with "type": "card";
        completing it moves it to the table's Done column. The record keeps its project
        (`bucket`), so its comments, replies and completion go there. The description is
        Markdown, rendered by the CLI. A key already tracked is refused, so a re-run never
        creates a duplicate. Returns the to-do (or card) id, or None when nothing was created.

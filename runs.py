"""Which sync runs on this computer watch what in Basecamp, so two homes never process the same events.

Two homes whose configs watch the same project with the same Basecamp login would each
read the same notifications, record the same owner input, acknowledge it twice and
deliver it to two agents. The shared state lock cannot stop that: it is per config. So
every timer run claims what it watches here before it reads anything, and refuses to run
beside a live claim that overlaps, naming the other home. Two runs of the same config
never collide here: they share one claim, and the state lock serializes them.

What a config watches (`watches`): its project, and, account-wide, the Pings of its login
("pings") and the to-dos assigned to its login anywhere ("assigned_todos" with "scope":
"account"). Two claims overlap when they share one of those with the same login: the same
Basecamp person when both know it, else the same CLI profile.

Each config's claim is one file, `<digest of the config path>.json`, in the directory
$BASECAMP_MATE_RUNS (default ~/.local/state/basecamp-mate/runs): the config, the home,
the login, the watches, the run's pid and its process start time, and when it last ran.
A claim is live while its run is still going (the pid probe, checked against the recorded
start time because pids are recycled) or it ran within STALE seconds and its config still
exists; the timer runs every 30 seconds, so a home whose timer was stopped, whose run was
killed or whose config was removed stops blocking within STALE. Checking and claiming are
one step under a lock, so two homes starting together cannot both claim.

The override is deliberate: "allow_duplicate": true in the config, or `--allow-duplicate`
on one run. `sync.py status` (also `basecamp-mate status`) lists every claim, live or
stale, and any sync.py process running that holds none.
